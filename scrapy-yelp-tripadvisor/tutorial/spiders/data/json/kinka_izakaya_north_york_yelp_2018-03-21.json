This is a great place to take friends and family, for casual or special occasions. I especially like that they play traditional Japanese music in the bathroom and have brought my grandparents here for lunch so that they could experience that as well. The restaurant is a lot quieter during lunch. It can get pretty loud for dinner. "},

It's unique among the small choices for Toronto Izakaya, but the staff KNOW what they are doing. Service and food is consistently high quality and memorable. I can't recall ever ordering anything on their menu that I didn't like, probably because it's so fresh! They make some great cocktails, too."},

My only wish is that \u00a0the serving portion would be larger.

After asking the staff to follow up twice, the three bowls of noodles finally arrived. We were not pleased because the udon were 42 minutes apart from the first dish that arrived. Although the staff didn't do anything about it, after complaining to the manager, she offered to remove the items from our bill. She even went the extra mile to offer free desserts and brought us a big pot of green tea. We really appreciate the great service; however, 42 minutes is a serious problem because imagine there's only the two of you, your food arrives, your friend's food arrives 42 minutes later...."}
