All you can eat is worth it. Great selection and you can get individual pots. What's even better? They have a sauce station and even get unlimited eggs! Eat until you explode. Beef and lamb slices were so good. I'm drooling thinking about my experience!"},

It was still fairly empty but by the time we left at 8.30 the place was definitely filled up. I was really worried about coming here with the less than desirable reviews from others about cleanness, but I thought it was ok didn't seem as bad as others made me think it would be. "},

{"date": "\n        12/16/2017\n    ", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "An abundance of vegetarian and vegan options!! Hotpot to me screams meat-based broths, raw meat slices, fish balls etc, so I was so pleasantly surprised to see at least 3 vegetarian/vegan broths (we all had the veggie and tofu broth which is 1/2 that has no additional $3 charge, but other veg options include wintermelon, Chinese herbs) and a huge list of fresh veggies (from taro to fresh spinach to lotus root) and lots of tofu (silky, frozen, curds). There's also an abundance of meat and seafood options obviously, and everything was nicely thinly sliced and so fresh looking. Tip- don't go crazy with ordering because portion sizes are huge especially for veggies, so order 1 per 2-3 people then order more if you have to later to reduce food waste (I don't think they penalize/fine you for leftovers if you leave them undisturbed). Unlimited sauce and beverage (sweetened soy milk, plum juice, honey green tea) refills. Each person can get their own pot and stove top. "},
