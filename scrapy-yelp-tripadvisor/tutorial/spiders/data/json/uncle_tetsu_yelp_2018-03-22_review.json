These cakes go out the door quick and taste best fresh so you better wait in line if you want to snag one. The cakes are amazingly soft and rich, I can't wait for one to open up in my hometown: Vancouver!"},

My boyfriend and I stopped by on a Wednesday around 5pm and there was no line. The shop is divided into two mini shops with separate entrances. One side sells the infamous Japanese cheesecakes (which are $10 each) and the other side sells cheesecake tarts (which are $3.50 each). We bought one cheesecake and two tarts (matcha and cheese). The tarts were quite delicious! I preferred the matcha one as the cheese one was quite cheesy. The cheesecake was alright. I've never had Japanese cheesecake before, so I didn't know what to expect. The texture and flavour are very light. I almost feel like it would be better with some sauce, like a strawberry or blueberry sauce. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't be running back for more."},

I like how Japanese cheesecakes are much lighter and less sweet than the typical American cheesecake, and Uncle Tetsu's ~CA$10 Original 6 inch Japanese Cheesecake is on point with all of that. I hear that the wait times and lines for these cheesecakes can get pretty long, and I personally don't believe they're worth waiting more than 15 minutes for, but these yummy clouds of delightfulness are definitely worth the money and a wonderful way to brighten up your day! Mmm."},

This is the famous Julie cheesecake from Japan that everyone raves about. My husband got us some from downtown and we were both blown away. We love how it's not super sweet and how it is so soft and light. It is delicious and we will definitely be back next time to get some more. Delicious delicious delicious"},

Well i already try it before in Asia. After 2 years since it opened, I finally walk in here and try because there wasn't any line up on a Friday night around 9:45ish. I was the 6th in line and there were like 18 ppl in total approximately. However I had to wait for 35mins in line to buy it. It is $10cad for a whole cake which the size of the cake is not that big. Only allow one customer per cake. I do recommend try to go after the rush hours and not to go during winter condition with extreme cold weather e.g -10 and below because you might end up lining up outside unless you don't feel cold. \u00a0The cake taste not so sweet which is perfect for people like doesn't like extreme sweet taste. I can taste the cheese within the cake. It is better to eat it fresh and the cake of the portion can serve 2 to 3 people max depends how hungry you are. "},

Personally I prefer the lighter taste and feel of Japanese cheesecake vs the heavier, New York style one. The cake is fluffy and falls apart in your mouth upon first forkful - it's very delicate. The sugar also feels lighter and not as dense."},

Their freshly baked Japanese cheesecake is like none other, with a unique light, spongy, airy texture and just the right amount of cheesiness that instantly melts in your mouth. I can see why there is always a long lineup at their store... it's so good and not overtly dense that I even snuck another slice as my breakfast!"},

I had missed it when I went to Osaka last February, so I was pretty set on trying it here. In case you've never heard of it, you should really google it!

It is so soft and puffy but in terms of the taste , it was like an omelette with lot of eggs with a little bit sugar.... seriously the egg flavor dominates... very moderate! I don't know why there is always a line-up. I had to wait for 40 minutes too. When I put it in fridge and tried it when it got cold, tasted better! It was first and last time..."},
