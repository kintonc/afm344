It's actually a lot bigger inside than I anticipated and quite cozy! Prices are on the more expensive side, but it is an izakaya after all. Between four friends, we ordered 5 dishes and ended up paying about $20 each after taxes and tip so in the end, it wasn't too bad! Here's one of my favourite dishes I tried: the salmon rice don ($15). A nice blend of fish roe, rice, veggies, beets amongst the salmon sashimi. Very delicious & nutritious - I'd recommend it!"},

I gave it a couple of chances since their recent change, tried their regular menu as well as their set menu, but it just wasn't up to par. \u00a0I'm not sure if the owner or chef has changed, but they seem to have \"cheaped out\" on the food quality and quantity. \u00a0My previous review indicated that this place was great BECAUSE of their consistency, but even the service was worse this time around!"},

The aburi hako sushi-salmon, crispy shrimp, spicy mayo is a good combination in terms of flavour. I've always enjoyed the ODEN-bonito base broth with fish cakes, egg, daikon. This is perfect for winter with the spicy soup and different variety of fish balls."},

Especially the Oyster with Cheese, only tiny tiny piece on each oyster shell, and the shell looks like reuse due to the outside didn't keep any original color, even after BBQ, you can still see some black or grey color, but the whole thing is white. Disgusting!"},

The food itself was okay; the pork belly was mostly fat and the quail so dry we could see the individual fibers.

Interior was great with good music. Really meant for gatherings and drinking as well. Definitely coming here again!"},
