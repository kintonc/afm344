{"date": "\n        2/25/2018\n    ", "rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "Worst sushi I have ever had. First of all, the rice is very blant. There's no hint of vinegary or sweetness in it. I ordered a sweet potato roll and red dragon roll, and they gave me a chewy salmon that tasted like it's not supposed to be use for any sushi but for cooking instead, also the tempura shrimp inside the red dragon roll is stale as it can be. The rolls tasted very old all in all, though they give you bigs rolls, because Korean sushi rolls are usually massive. I would never in my life try this place again. It's not cheap at all like other reviewers in yelp says so. Very very disappointed. I suggest you make your own sushi at home instead."},
{"date": "\n        1/7/2018\n    ", "rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Portions are huge and fish seems very fresh! I always crave this place whenever I want to eat some really good and decently priced sushi. There are two locations on Yonge but I like this one better since it is not as crowded as the other one and it is easier to find parking here. This place is generally for take out, but there are a few tables if you are planning on dining in. Orders don't take long either, if you're ordering take out it is usually ready between 10-15 mins. This time we got the small party combo and spicy salmon roll but we also like to get the sushi bong special. I especially like this place because they don't cheap out on ingredients and they also don't include a lot of rice with the sushi or rolls. Although it is a bit far, I would definitely keep coming back here."},

Sushi Bong is a very economical \u00a0Korean owned sushi shop that pumps out rolls like nobody's business. Yes, there are fancier and higher grade sushi shops out there, but for your dollar, these guys will do the trick. Their sushi bong special is always a good choice. For roughly $10 and change, you get 8 jumbo sized rolls that are basically california rolls but with salmon added, 4 salmon rolls, and 5 nice juicy slabs of assorted sushi. That's a lot of fresh fish for $10! Very filling, this special can be shared by 2. You definitely will get high off sushi from eating here; pun intended."},

The price here is very cheap, and the quantity is good, however the quality of the rolls and fish is just average. For the chirashi bowl, the variety of fish provided is very average (there was the usual tuna, salmon, crab meat, etc. nothing fancy)."},

You've got your basic maki rolls (eg spicy salmon) and special rolls (I \u00a0would recommended dynamite, unagi, red/green dragon roll, or anything else on the menu!!). We always order a platter of sashimi to accompany the rolls. What's awesome is that they have different sizes to accommodate the number of people dining and even a small is A LOT. "},

This location features much more seating for eat-in customers, newer decor, and more parking compared to its older sibling. The highlight of Sushi Bong are its generous portions of sushi at really cheap prices. One order of dynamite rolls ($6.99), which are gigantic, is enough for my dinner. My default order is their Sushi Bong Special (~$11), which features California rolls (which can be subbed for other rolls if you're willing to pay extra), sushi, and nigiri. Service is quick and friendly, with orders being ready as soon as 3 minutes after the initial call. All in all, Sushi Bong is a great spot for anyone that wants sushi takeout in the area."},

I was not in a rush and closeby, so wanted to see how fast they made the sushi by ordering on the spot. Got the Sushi Bong's Special and it was done in less than 5 mins. The location is mainly a takeout place, with room for 3 or so pairs (there was 1 sitting down at the time, with other tables all holding takeout). Parking was not a challenge and I managed to find a spot on the surface level. "},

You'd definitely be satisfied with a single roll order, and could probably split one roll between two people if you're just looking for a snack or a light meal. This place is definitely more of a takeout place, because there's only one /actual/ table. The service is poor, with dismissive and short workers, but the food itself makes me want to come back. The rolls are a bit on the pricey side, but worth it considering the quantity."},
